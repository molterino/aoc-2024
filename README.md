# Advent of Code 2024 üéÑ

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository!  
Here, you'll find my solutions to the programming puzzles from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge for the 2024 season.

## What is Advent of Code? ü§î

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place every December, running from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, a new set of two puzzles is released, gradually increasing in complexity. The challenge is a great way to:

- Practice programming skills
- Explore algorithms and problem-solving techniques
- Experiment with new tools or languages
- Have fun solving festive puzzles during the holiday season

The challenge is open to everyone, regardless of skill level, and offers a fun and rewarding experience for participants.

## My Approach üöÄ

For this season, my solutions will be primarily written in **C#**, leveraging the features of **.NET 8**. My focus is on creating **working solutions**, not necessarily perfect or optimized ones. The priority is to solve the puzzles effectively, even if there‚Äôs room for improvement in code quality or performance.

If time permits, I‚Äôd love to experiment with additional solutions in **Python**, but that depends entirely on how much time and energy I have to dedicate to the challenge.
